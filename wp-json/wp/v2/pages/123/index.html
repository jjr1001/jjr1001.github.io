Both institutions currently focus on nurturing and expanding Israel-UK scientific cooperation as a strategic goal. Indeed, the recent award to the two institutions under the British Council UK-Israel Strategic Collaboration program, led by Oppenheimer and Jelinek, manifests both the commitment of the two institutions, the track record of the collaborative efforts by the Principle Investigators and the significant potential for enhancing the scientific links between the UK and Israel through the proposed initiative.

Oppenheimer and Jelinek \u2013 which constitute core research directions in both institutions and historically have enjoyed interest and research activity in UK-Israel scientific and technological relationships.<\/p><p>Specific events will take place during the next 2 years, and these include:<\/p><p>1. Strategic planning designed to lay the groundwork of the project, create network, making research plans.<br \/>2. Promote collaborative research through virtual and face-to-face meetings, symposia, student-exchange and sharing research facilities.<br \/>3. Promote applied research and establish viable collaborations with industry.<br \/>4. Communicate academic research to students, researchers, and the general public.<br \/>5.

Meetings and workshops will be dedicated to both presenting and discussing general topic and strategic aspects and brainstorming designed to address specific research challenges arising through the collaborative research. Students will gain experience in biotechnology engineering, standard microbiology techniques, and a broad range of analytical techniques. Working closely in an interdisciplinary team with bio-scientists and engineers, the students will be mapping sources of variability throughout the process e.g., identifying factors leading to batch-to-batch variability, monitoring and controlling the manufacturing and bacterial presence\/specifications to deliver well-characterized platforms for specific low-cost, sensitive and rapid detection platforms.<\/p><p><strong>&#8211; Public outreach, UK-Israel, 2023-24:<\/strong> The activities will be communicated to both the general public and scientific community through several channels, including the two institutions PR departments, social media campaigns, and dissemination avenues.
